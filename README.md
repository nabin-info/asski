# asski
asski contains various techniques toward remapping ASCII charset to various targets.

As a side-effect, you can learn a lot about unicode experimenting with things like this.

I wanna thank some great places that made this all possible:

* [unicode.org](http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/)
* [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode))
    
Please make pull requests and lets keep it funky.
